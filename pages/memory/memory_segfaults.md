# Segmentation Faults(Segfaults)
=====

## What is a segfault?

A segmentation fault (aka segfault) is a common condition that causes programs to crash. Segfaults are caused by a program trying to read or write an illegal memory location. Program memory is divided into different segments: 

* a text segment for program instructions
* a data segment for variables and arrays defined at compile time
* a stack segment for temporary (or automatic) variables defined in subroutines and functions
* a heap segment for variables allocated during runtime by functions, such as malloc (in C) 

A segfault occurs when a reference to a variable falls outside the segment where that variable resides, or when a write is attempted to a location that is in a read-only segment. In practice, segfaults are almost always due to trying to read or write a non-existent array element, not properly defining a pointer before using it, or (in C programs) accidentally using a variable's value as an address (see the scanf example below).  
On Unix family operating systems, a signal called SIGSEGV - signal #11, defined in the system header file signal.h - is then sent to to process. The default action for SIGSEGV is abnormal termination: the process ends and an application core file may be written (depending on the system's configuration).

## Why does a segfault occur?

A segmentation fault can occur under the following circumstances:

1. A bug (software defect) in the program or command is encountered, for example a buffer overflow (an attempt to access memory beyond the end of an array). This can typically be resolved by applying errata or vendor software updates.

2. A hardware problem affects the virtual memory subsystem. For example, a RAM DIMM or CPU cache is defective.

3. An attempt is made to execute a program that was not compiled/built correctly.

## How to inteprete segfault log? 

```bash
May 18 23:55:05 dhcp-192-66 kernel: test[7779]: segfault at 0 ip 00007fdddf181664 sp 00007ffcbb5eb568 error 6 in libc-2.17.so[7fdddf0f2000+1c3000]
```

* **test[7779]**   
   program name and pid number
* **segfault at 0**
   memory address (in hex) that caused the segfault when the program tried to access it. Here the address is 0, so we have a null dereference, usually it is a null pointer 
* **ip 00007fdddf181664**    
   register name and register value for current running instruction
* **sp 00007ffcbb5eb568**  
   regester name and register value for stack (top of stack)
* **error 6**  
   error and return code, which is defined in arch/x86/mm/fault.c

## segfault error code
```
/*
 * Page fault error code bits:
 *
 *   bit 0 ==    0: no page found       1: protection fault(eg. writing to a read-only mapping)
 *   bit 1 ==    0: read access         1: write access
 *   bit 2 ==    0: kernel-mode access  1: user-mode access
 *   bit 3 ==                           1: use of reserved bit detected(kernel will panic if this happens)
 *   bit 4 ==                           1: fault was an instruction fetch, not data read or write
 *   bit 5 ==                           1: protection keys block access

## Example
* calling memset() as shown below would cause a program to segfault:

   ```bash
   $ cat test.c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>
   
   int main()
   {
       memset((char *)0x0, 1, 100);
   }
   
   $ gcc test.c -o test
   
   $ ./test
   Segmentation fault
   
   $ sudo tail -n 1 /var/log/messages
